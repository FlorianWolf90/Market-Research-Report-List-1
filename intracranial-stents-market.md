<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intracranial Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-expandable Stents</li><li>Balloon-expanded Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The intracranial stents market is primarily divided into self-expandable stents and balloon-expanded stents. Self-expandable stents are designed to automatically expand upon deployment, providing consistent support within the arterial lumen, making them suitable for conditions like stenosis. In contrast, balloon-expanded stents require inflation of a balloon to expand and secure placement, offering precise control during the procedure. Both types are essential in treating intracranial vascular conditions, enhancing patient outcomes by improving blood flow and reducing the risk of complications.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Intracranial Stents Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ischemic Stroke</li><li>Hemorrhagic Stroke</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The intracranial stents market is pivotal in treating ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. Ischemic strokes, caused by blocked arteries, benefit from stenting to restore blood flow and prevent further damage. In cases of hemorrhagic strokes, where blood vessels rupture, stents help stabilize the affected area and reduce pressure. Both applications enhance patient outcomes, promoting recovery and reducing disabilities. The market continues to evolve with advancements in technology, providing innovative stenting solutions tailored for these critical conditions.</p></p>
