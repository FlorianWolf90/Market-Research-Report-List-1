<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pacing Lead Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unipolar Pacing Lead</li><li>Bipolar Pacing Lead</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pacing lead markets are categorized into unipolar and bipolar types based on their electrical configuration. Unipolar pacing leads have a single electrode placed within the heart, relying on the metal casing of the pulse generator as the ground electrode, making them simpler but more susceptible to interference. In contrast, bipolar pacing leads feature two electrodes, enhancing signal quality and reducing the risk of electrical noise. Both types serve critical roles in cardiac pacing, catering to different patient needs and device compatibility.</p></p>
