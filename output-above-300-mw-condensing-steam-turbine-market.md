<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Output Above 300 MW Condensing Steam Turbine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Recombustion</li><li>Non-recombustion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Output Above 300 MW Condensing Steam Turbine market is divided into two primary types: Recombustion and Non-recombustion. Recombustion steam turbines utilize a process where unutilized energy from exhaust gases is redirected back into the combustion cycle, enhancing efficiency and output. In contrast, Non-recombustion steam turbines operate without this reintroduction of exhaust energy, relying solely on steam generated from the initial combustion process. Both types aim to optimize power generation, catering to different operational and efficiency needs in large-scale energy production.</p></p>
