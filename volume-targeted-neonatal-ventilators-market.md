<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Volume Targeted Neonatal Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilators</li><li>Non-Invasive Ventilators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Volume Targeted Neonatal Ventilators market is segmented into two primary types: invasive and non-invasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators are designed for direct airway management, delivering precise tidal volumes through endotracheal tubes, crucial for critically ill neonates. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, provide respiratory support through techniques such as CPAP or bi-level positive airway pressure, avoiding invasive procedures while still ensuring effective ventilation. Both types play vital roles in managing neonatal respiratory conditions while prioritizing patient safety and comfort.</p></p>
