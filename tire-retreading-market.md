<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tire Retreading Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre Cure</li><li>Mold Cure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The tire retreading market includes two main types: Pre-Cure and Mold Cure. Pre-Cure retreading involves applying a pre-vulcanized tread rubber onto the tire casing, which is then cured in a chamber. It offers flexibility in tread patterns and is cost-effective. Mold Cure retreading uses uncured rubber, which is molded and vulcanized directly onto the tire casing in a mold. This method provides better tread adhesion and durability, making it suitable for heavy-duty applications. Both methods extend tire life, reduce costs, and promote sustainability.</p></p>
