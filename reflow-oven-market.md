<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Reflow Oven Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Convection Ovens</li><li>Vapour Phase Oven</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The reflow oven market comprises primarily two types: convection ovens and vapor phase ovens. Convection ovens utilize hot air to evenly distribute heat for soldering components on printed circuit boards (PCBs), offering precise temperature control and faster cooling. Vapor phase ovens, on the other hand, operate by immersing PCBs in a vaporized liquid, which condenses on the surface, ensuring uniform heating and reducing thermal stress. Both types cater to varying production needs and are essential for efficient soldering processes in electronics manufacturing.</p></p>
