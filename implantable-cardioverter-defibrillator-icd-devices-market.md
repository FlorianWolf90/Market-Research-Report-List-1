<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Chamber ICD</li><li>Dual-Chamber ICD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) market is categorized into two main types: Single-Chamber ICDs and Dual-Chamber ICDs. Single-Chamber ICDs are designed with one lead, typically placed in either the atrium or ventricle, focusing on monitoring and treating arrhythmias in one cardiac chamber. In contrast, Dual-Chamber ICDs utilize two leads, allowing for enhanced monitoring and pacing of both the atrium and ventricle, which improves coordination of heart contractions and provides more comprehensive treatment for patients with complex cardiac conditions.</p></p>
