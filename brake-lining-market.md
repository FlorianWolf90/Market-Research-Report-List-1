<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Brake Lining Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Asbestos Type</li><li>Semimetal Type</li><li>NAO Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The brake lining market consists of three primary types: Asbestos Type, Semimetal Type, and NAO (Non-Asbestos Organic) Type. Asbestos Type brake linings, once popular for their durability and heat resistance, have been largely phased out due to health concerns. Semimetal Type linings offer excellent performance and are a blend of metal fibers and other materials, providing good heat dissipation. NAO Type linings use organic materials, ensuring lower environmental impact while offering decent braking performance, making them increasingly preferred in modern vehicles.</p></p>
