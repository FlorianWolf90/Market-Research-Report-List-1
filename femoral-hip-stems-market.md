<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Femoral Hip Stems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cemented Femoral Hip Stems</li><li>Cementless Femoral Hip Stems</li><li>Hybrid Femoral Hip Stems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The femoral hip stems market comprises three primary types: cemented, cementless, and hybrid femoral hip stems. Cemented femoral hip stems utilize bone cement for secure fixation, offering immediate stability, especially in older patients. Cementless femoral hip stems rely on biological fixation, promoting bone growth into the stem for long-term stability, often preferred in younger patients. Hybrid femoral hip stems combine features of both, with a cemented stem for the femur and a cementless design for the acetabulum, catering to diverse patient needs.</p></p>
