<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Lithotripsy Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intracorporeal Lithotripsy</li><li>Extracorporeal Lithotripsy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Medical Lithotripsy Device market is primarily divided into two types: intracorporeal and extracorporeal lithotripsy. Intracorporeal lithotripsy involves using devices inserted into the body to directly fragment stones, providing targeted treatment with minimal impact on surrounding tissues. In contrast, extracorporeal lithotripsy employs non-invasive techniques like shock waves to disintegrate stones from outside the body. Both methods are crucial for treating urolithiasis, with distinct advantages tailored to different clinical scenarios and patient needs.</p></p>
