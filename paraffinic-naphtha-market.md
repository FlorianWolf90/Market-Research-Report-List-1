<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Paraffinic Naphtha Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Straight Run Naphtha</li><li>Secondary Processing Naphtha</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The paraffinic naphtha market is divided into two main types: straight run naphtha and secondary processing naphtha. Straight run naphtha is derived directly from crude oil distillation, characterized by its light, paraffinic composition, making it suitable for gasoline blending and petrochemical feedstock. In contrast, secondary processing naphtha results from additional refining processes, such as catalytic reforming or hydrocracking, enhancing its properties for specific applications, including octane-boosting and aromatic production. Both types serve crucial roles in energy and chemical sectors.</p></p>
