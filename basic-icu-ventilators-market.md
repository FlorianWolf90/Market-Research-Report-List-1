<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Basic ICU Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilation</li><li>Non-invasive Ventilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Basic ICU Ventilators market is categorized into two main types: invasive and non-invasive ventilation. Invasive ventilation involves the use of artificial airways, such as endotracheal tubes, to deliver respiratory support directly to the lungs, often in critically ill patients. Non-invasive ventilation, on the other hand, utilizes masks or nasal interfaces to provide respiratory assistance without the need for intubation, making it suitable for patients with less severe respiratory distress. Both types cater to diverse patient needs in intensive care settings.</p></p>
