<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vagus Nerve Stimulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Vagus Nerve Stimulation</li><li>Percutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Vagus Nerve Stimulators market consists of two main types: Direct Vagus Nerve Stimulation (DVNS) and Percutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation (PVNS). DVNS involves implanting a device that directly stimulates the vagus nerve through surgical intervention, commonly used for epilepsy and treatment-resistant depression. Conversely, PVNS employs a non-invasive approach, stimulating the vagus nerve via the skin, which may be utilized for various conditions without the need for surgery. These technologies aim to modulate nerve activity to alleviate symptoms and improve patient outcomes.</p></p>
